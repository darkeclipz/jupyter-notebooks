# LaTeX style for Jupyter Notebook
## By Lars Rotgers

### Installation
The fonts are embedded in the CSS file in BASE64.

 1. Copy the CSS file into: C:/Users/<User>/.jupyter/custom/
 2. Restart Jupyter Notebook

### Other

Because the fonts are embedded, the print preview & export to HTML will also support the font.
